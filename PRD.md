- No systematic way to improve from successful conversions

**Impact:**
- Low conversion rates despite high traffic
- Delayed response to high-intent leads
- Inconsistent customer experience
- Inability to scale personalized engagement

### 3. Solution Overview

Agent Dojo provides a no-code interface where users can:
1. Define business objectives in natural language
2. Auto-generate specialized agent teams
3. Deploy swarms that respond to real-time events
4. Continuously improve through feedback loops

```

#### 6.2 Performance Requirements
- **Response Time:** <2s for swarm creation
- **Throughput:** 1000 events/second
- **Availability:** 99% uptime during demo
- **Concurrency:** 10 simultaneous swarms

#### 6.3 Integration Requirements
- **LLM Providers:** OpenAI GPT-4, Claude
- **Tools:** Email (SendGrid), SMS (Twilio), CRM (Mock API)
- **Data Sources:** PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Monitoring:** Basic logging, metrics dashboard

### 7. User Workflows

#### 7.1 Create New Swarm
```
1. User enters intent: "Recover abandoned high-value carts within 24 hours"
2. System suggests tools: [Email, SMS, Calculator API]
3. User uploads training data: successful_recoveries.csv
4. System generates agents:
   - Cart Analyzer (assess abandonment reason)
   - Timing Optimizer (find best contact time)
   - Message Crafter (personalize outreach)
   - Channel Coordinator (select email vs SMS)
5. User reviews and activates swarm
```

#### 7.2 Monitor & Optimize
```
1. User views dashboard showing swarm performance
2. Identifies underperforming agent
3. Uploads additional training examples
4. System retrains specific agent
5. A/B tests new version against current
```

### 8. Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Swarm Creation Time** | <2 minutes | Timer from start to activation |
| **Lead Response Time** | <5 minutes | Event timestamp to action |
| **Conversion Lift** | +20% | Compare swarm vs baseline |
| **User Activation** | 80% create swarm | Users who complete setup |
